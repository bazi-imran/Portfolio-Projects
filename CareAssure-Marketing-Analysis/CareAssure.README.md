# CareAssure Marketing Insights

## Project Overview: This project analyzes marketing campaign performance at CareAssure Health to provide recommendations for future marketing budget allocation across campaign categories.

**Founded in 2016, CareAssure Health provides medical insurance coverage to thousands of customers across the United States. In 2019, they launched new marketing campaign categories** focusing on wellness education, plan affordability, and preventative care promotion. Customers can choose from four plan tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—each offering different premiums and claim coverage rates.

With next year's marketing budget planning, CareAssure seeks to evaluate how effective their different campaign categories have been in achieving two key goals: driving new customer acquisitions and expanding brand recognition nationwide. This analysis will help inform smarter budget allocation decisions.

# Data Structure
