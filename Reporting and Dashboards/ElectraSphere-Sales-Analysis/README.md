# ElectraShpere Sales Analysis 

Established in 2019, ElectraSphere is a global e-commerce electronics retailer that has sold over 100,000 orders worldwide since its inception. This analysis aimed to uncover insights across key performance areas—sales trends, product performance, marketing effectiveness, loyalty program impact, and operational efficiency—by examining transactional and marketing datasets.

Using Excel, I cleaned and structured the data with advanced techniques such as Pivot Tables, aggregation functions, conditional formatting, and basic statistical methods. I created visual summaries and trend analyses to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders across marketing, product, finance, and operations teams.

## About the Data
The dataset contains global sales and order information for ElectraSpheres’ product portfolio, comprising approximately 108,000 rows.

## Summary of the Insights
* **Yearly trends:** Between 2019 and 2022, the company generated over $28M in revenue across 100K+ orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. The strongest year was 2020, which recorded $10.2M in revenue, an AOV peak of $300, and a 163% YoY revenue increase, likely fueled by pandemic-driven spending. By contrast, 2021 marked the highest order volume (36K orders), while 2022 saw a steep decline (-46% revenue), highlighting volatility in customer demand.

* **Seasonality:** The business shows strong seasonality, with November and December consistently driving the highest sales and revenue due to holiday spending. Conversely, January and February tend to record the lowest activity, suggesting post-holiday slowdowns. March 2020 stood out with a major spike in orders and revenue, coinciding with initial pandemic purchasing surges.

* **Product performance:** The Apple AirPods Headphones were the most popular item, selling 48K units and generating $7.7M over the period. The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor led in total revenue, with $9.9M from 23K sales. Meanwhile, the Bose Soundsport Headphones underperformed, contributing just $3.3K from 27 sales across four years.

* **Product performance by region:** AirPods were the top-selling product globally, with 18,574 units ($3.1M) sold in North America, 11,227 units ($1.7M) in EMEA, 4,226 units ($0.6M) in APAC, and 1,911 units ($0.3M) in LATAM, reinforcing its global appeal.

* **Refund rates:** The ThinkPad Laptop (12%) and MacBook Air Laptop (11%) had the highest refund percentages, while the AirPods (2,634 refunds) and 27in 4K Gaming Monitor (1,444 refunds) accounted for the largest absolute refund volumes, suggesting quality or expectation issues on high-volume items.

* **Marketing channel performance:** Direct marketing channels dominated, driving 84K orders and $23.2M in revenue. In contrast, social media was the weakest performer, contributing just 1.3K orders and $300K revenue.

* **Loyalty program efficacy:** Loyalty membership grew rapidly from 4% of customers in 2019 (2K customers) to a peak of 43% in 2021 (19.5K customers) before settling at 24% in 2022 (11K customers). Over the full period, loyalty members contributed 39% of total revenue ($11M) and 42% of total orders (46K). They also showed higher average order value (AOV $240 vs. $275 for non-loyalty) and steadily increased their share of sales, indicating the program successfully boosted repeat purchasing and long-term revenue impact despite the post-2021 decline in participation.


## Recommendations

* **Leverage seasonality with targeted campaigns:** Since November–December consistently drive peak revenue, the company should allocate higher marketing budgets and launch bundled promotions ahead of the holiday season. Conversely, January–February require creative campaigns (e.g., New Year upgrades, student discounts) to smooth out post-holiday slumps.

* **Prioritize high-performing products while addressing weak links:** AirPods and the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor are core revenue drivers and should remain heavily promoted. However, underperforming products like the Bose Soundsport Headphones should be either repositioned through niche targeting or phased out to improve product portfolio efficiency.

* **Improve quality control on high-ticket items:** Laptops (ThinkPad, MacBook Air) show the highest refund rates, potentially harming customer trust. Strengthening supplier QA, improving pre-purchase product descriptions, and offering extended warranties could reduce costly returns.

* **Refocus marketing channel strategy:** Direct marketing outperforms all other channels, while social media lags. Investing further in direct/email marketing while testing influencer-driven or retargeting strategies on social platforms could rebalance performance.

* **Reinvigorate the loyalty program:** Although loyalty participation peaked in 2021, the 2022 drop suggests retention challenges. Introducing tiered rewards, exclusive early-access sales, or referral incentives could sustain growth in membership and revenue contribution.

* **Explore regional opportunities:** North America and EMEA drive the bulk of sales, but APAC and LATAM remain underpenetrated. Tailored regional campaigns and localized product bundles could unlock additional growth in these markets.

## Future Considerations
