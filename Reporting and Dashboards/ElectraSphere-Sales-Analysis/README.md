# ElectraShpere Sales Analysis 

Established in 2019, ElectraSphere is a global e-commerce electronics retailer that has sold over 100,000 orders worldwide since its inception. This analysis aimed to uncover insights across key performance areas—sales trends, product performance, marketing effectiveness, loyalty program impact, and operational efficiency—by examining transactional and marketing datasets.

Using Excel, I cleaned and structured the data with advanced techniques such as Pivot Tables, aggregation functions, conditional formatting, and basic statistical methods. I created visual summaries and trend analyses to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders across marketing, product, finance, and operations teams.

## About the Data
The dataset contains global sales and order information for ElectraSpheres’ product portfolio, comprising approximately 108,000 rows.
