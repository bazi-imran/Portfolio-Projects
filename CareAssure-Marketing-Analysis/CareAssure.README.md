# CareAssure-Marketing-Analysis
CareAssure Health Insurance, established in 2016, provides medical insurance coverage to thousands 
of customers across the United States. The company offers four plan tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and 
platinum—each with customized premiums and claim coverage rates. In 2019, CareAssure launched 
marketing campaigns focused on wellness education, plan affordability, and preventative care 
promotion.

I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze marketing, signup, and claims metrics, 
evaluating campaign performance and providing budget allocation recommendations. The project had two 
main objectives: increasing customer signups and expanding CareAssure's brand awareness nationwide. 
To communicate these findings effectively, I created a PowerPoint presentation detailing key insights 
and recommendations for the marketing team.
