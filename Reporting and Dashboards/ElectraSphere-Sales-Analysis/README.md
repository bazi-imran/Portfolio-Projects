# ElectraShpere Sales Analysis 

Established in 2019, ElectraSphere is a global e-commerce electronics retailer that has sold over 100,000 orders worldwide since its inception. This analysis aimed to uncover insights across key performance areas—sales trends, product performance, marketing effectiveness, loyalty program impact, and operational efficiency—by examining transactional and marketing datasets.

Using Excel, I cleaned and structured the data with advanced techniques such as Pivot Tables, aggregation functions, conditional formatting, and basic statistical methods. I created visual summaries and trend analyses to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders across marketing, product, finance, and operations teams.

## About the Data
The dataset contains global sales and order information for ElectraSpheres’ product portfolio, comprising approximately 108,000 rows.

## Summary of the Insights
*Revenue growth volatility: Sales peaked in 2020 with a 163% YoY increase, but declined in both 2021 (-10%) and 2022 (-46%), showing heavy dependence on short-term market surges.
*Customer loyalty impact: Loyalty members grew from 2K in 2019 to 45K+ by 2022 (2,183% cumulative growth), driving higher order counts and stabilizing AOV despite revenue swings.
*Average Order Value (AOV): Peaked at $300 in 2020, then declined to $230 by 2022, signaling potential discounting, product mix shifts, or waning premium purchases.
*Product-level performance: Apple products showed high AOV (e.g., MacBook Air at $1,500+), but also higher refund rates (up to 18% in 2019–2020), especially for AirPods, which consistently made up the majority of refunds.
*Order trends: Order volumes doubled between 2019 and 2020 (+101%), but sharply contracted in 2022 (-40%), aligning with revenue decline and customer churn outside loyalty programs.


## Recommendations
* **Strengthen loyalty program retention:** Loyalty customers drove consistent order activity and higher long-term value — expand incentives, tiered rewards, and personalized offers to sustain growth.

* **Stabilize AOV:** Investigate product bundling or upsell strategies to offset the decline in AOV since 2020.

* **Reduce refund rates:** Focus on product quality and post-purchase support, particularly for high-volume items like AirPods, to reduce return costs and improve customer satisfaction.

* **Diversify revenue drivers:** Reduce reliance on single-year growth spikes by balancing marketing spend across acquisition and retention.

* **Monitor product performance:** Given high refunds on premium products, implement feedback loops and adjust inventory/marketing strategies to align with customer expectations.

## Future Considerations
Further analysis could look into geographic trends and how regional performance differs across the dimensions analyzed in this project.
