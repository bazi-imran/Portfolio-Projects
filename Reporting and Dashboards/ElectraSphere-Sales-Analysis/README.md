# ElectraShpere Sales Analysis 

Established in 2019, ElectraSphere is a global e-commerce electronics retailer that has sold over 100,000 orders worldwide since its inception. This analysis aimed to uncover insights across key performance areas—sales trends, product performance, marketing effectiveness, loyalty program impact, and operational efficiency—by examining transactional and marketing datasets.

Using Excel, I cleaned and structured the data with advanced techniques such as Pivot Tables, aggregation functions, conditional formatting, and basic statistical methods. I created visual summaries and trend analyses to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders across marketing, product, finance, and operations teams.

## About the Data
The dataset contains global sales and order information for ElectraSpheres’ product portfolio, comprising approximately 108,000 rows.

## Summary of the Insights
* **Yearly trends:** Between 2019 and 2022, the company generated over $28M in revenue across 100K+ orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. The strongest year was 2020, which recorded $10.2M in revenue, an AOV peak of $300, and a 163% YoY revenue increase, likely fueled by pandemic-driven spending. By contrast, 2021 marked the highest order volume (36K orders), while 2022 saw a steep decline (-46% revenue), highlighting volatility in customer demand.

* **Seasonality:** The business shows strong seasonality, with November and December consistently driving the highest sales and revenue due to holiday spending. Conversely, January and February tend to record the lowest activity, suggesting post-holiday slowdowns. March 2020 stood out with a major spike in orders and revenue, coinciding with initial pandemic purchasing surges.

* **Product performance:** The Apple AirPods Headphones were the most popular item, selling 48K units and generating $7.7M over the period. The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor led in total revenue, with $9.9M from 23K sales. Meanwhile, the Bose Soundsport Headphones underperformed, contributing just $3.3K from 27 sales across four years.

* **Product performance by region:** AirPods were the top-selling product globally, with 18,574 units ($3.1M) sold in North America, 11,227 units ($1.7M) in EMEA, 4,226 units ($0.6M) in APAC, and 1,911 units ($0.3M) in LATAM — reinforcing its global appeal.

* **Marketing channel performance:** Direct marketing channels dominated, driving 84K orders and $23.2M in revenue. In contrast, social media was the weakest performer, contributing just 1.3K orders and $300K revenue. Notably, direct channels also attracted the most loyalty customers (23K), but email campaigns had the highest signup conversion rate (58%), second only to customers with unknown acquisition sources (59%).

* **Loyalty program efficacy:** The loyalty program grew significantly, expanding from 12% of customers in 2019 to 52% in 2022. In 2022 alone, loyalty members made 1K more purchases than non-members, spent an average of $30 more per order, and contributed $500K in additional revenue — proving its impact on retention and lifetime value.

* **Refund rates:** The ThinkPad Laptop (12%) and MacBook Air Laptop (11%) had the highest refund percentages, while the AirPods (2,636 refunds) and 27in 4K Gaming Monitor (1,444 refunds) accounted for the largest absolute refund volumes, suggesting quality or expectation issues on high-volume items.


## Recommendations
* **Strengthen loyalty program retention:** Loyalty customers drove consistent order activity and higher long-term value — expand incentives, tiered rewards, and personalized offers to sustain growth.

* **Stabilize AOV:** Investigate product bundling or upsell strategies to offset the decline in AOV since 2020.

* **Reduce refund rates:** Focus on product quality and post-purchase support, particularly for high-volume items like AirPods, to reduce return costs and improve customer satisfaction.

* **Diversify revenue drivers:** Reduce reliance on single-year growth spikes by balancing marketing spend across acquisition and retention.

* **Monitor product performance:** Given high refunds on premium products, implement feedback loops and adjust inventory/marketing strategies to align with customer expectations.

## Future Considerations
Further analysis could look into geographic trends and how regional performance differs across the dimensions analyzed in this project.
